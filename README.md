# Secure Note

Secure Note is a application for writing notes and hiding them from prying eyes.
It takes whatever you are currently typing and displays it in hexidecimal.
It also saves the document as hexidecimal.
It can translate that hexidecimal into words when you want to see what you have typed.

Secure Note is written with Python.
